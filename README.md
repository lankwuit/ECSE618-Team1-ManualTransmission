The simulator creates an immersive experience for the user by providing haptic feedback through the Haply platform. The player shifts through the gears of a manual transmission interface and feels the forces caused during the gear changes. The simulator also provides a visual representation of the gear changes and the engine RPM. An example of the force is shown below in red:
